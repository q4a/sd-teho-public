itmdescr_unarmed
{

}

itmname_rabble	{Poker}

Forged chimney poker. It can be even considered a weapon, if your enemy lets you to hit him suddenly from behind in the head.
}

itmname_slave_01	{Harpoon}
itmdescr_slave_01
{
This is just a whaler's harpoon, but it takes only one hit to gut a person by pulling it back. Yet, if the harpoon gets stuck, it can only be removed by cutting it out of the dead body. 
}

itmname_slave_02	{Machete}
itmdescr_slave_02
{
The local attraction. A long household knife made of low quality steel is widely used for cutting sugar cane and vines, and also as a handy weapon.
}

A short one-handed spear of the Indians of the Itza tribe, equipped with a crosspiece and a steel tip made of a broken trophy halberd.
}

itmname_blade_02	{War Club}

}

itmname_blade_03	{Stocco}
itmdescr_blade_03
{
A civil foil in Italian style. Three-edged non-bending stocco blade is ideal for piercing attacks, and the guard in the shape of crab claws allows to catch the weapon of the enemy. 
}

itmname_blade_04	{Messer}
itmdescr_blade_04
{
Reliable and easy to make long knife, which is quite popular in the Central Europe among the city militia and mercenaries with modest income.
}

itmname_blade_05	{Cutlass}
itmdescr_blade_05
{
A cutlass. Its wide slightly bent blade and a wide guard made of steel strips were meant to combine the merits of a saber and a rapier in one weapon. Still, the drawbacks were numerous as well.
}

itmname_blade_06	{Schiavona}
itmdescr_blade_06
{
A legendary rapier, wielded by the Dalmatian guards of Venetian doges. Its double-edged blade is perfect for bot piercing and slashing attacks, and its guard was called 'cradle' for the safety it provided to the hand of the wielder.
}

itmname_blade_07	{Ritterschwert}
itmdescr_blade_07
{
An archaic rapier of the heavy cavalry. Its heavy blade can cleave almost any armor. Still, its weight and balance make it nearly unusable in foot combat.

itmdescr_blade_08

}

itmname_blade_11	{Hanger}
itmdescr_blade_11
{
A boarding cutlass is a weapon for those who are at a short distance with death. Melee combat is not the simplest thing, but such a blade in a brave man's hand is a serious argument against any weapon.
}

itmname_blade_12	{Short Sabre}
itmdescr_blade_12
{
A short sabre is a convenient and compact weapon of footmen and gunners. It is slightly longer than a cutlass, but shorter than a saber. This allows to land precise strikes both in the commotion of an ongoing boarding and in open space.
}

itmname_blade_13	{Broadsword}
itmdescr_blade_13
{
This weapon has recently become rather popular by the officers in the Navy not only as a distinction, but also as a reliable combat blade, which could be quite effective in the hand of a strong and skilled man. Still, it's a bit heavy for duelling.
}

itmname_blade_14	{Walloon Sword}
itmdescr_blade_14
{
A combat rapier, popular among the guardsmen of the Old World. It requires not as much handwork, as mobility, agility and strength. But one can easily slash the forearm of any devotee of elegant fencing daring to challenge you.
}

itmname_blade_15	{Capodimonte}
itmdescr_blade_15
{
A naval foil with a bending blade, which is equally well suited for both peircing and slashing attacks. A simplified guard is still safe enough to block powerful slashing strikes.
}

itmname_blade_16	{Small Sword}
itmdescr_blade_16
{
A shortened rapier with elegant flat guard, which is worn with the formal clothes. This weapon has emerged rather recently under the influence of the French fencing school. It's too light for slashing, but it allows to attack with lightning speed.
}

itmname_blade_17	{Cup-hilt Rapier}
itmdescr_blade_17
{
A shortened handle of this foil preferred by Spanish duellists favors piercing attacks, but the blade is suitable for landing slashing strikes as well. A Bell-shaped guard with turned down edges safely protects the hand from enemy attacks.
}

itmname_blade_18	{Pappenheimer}
itmdescr_blade_18
{
A cavalry sword with a distinctive guard is a famous weapon of the cuirassiers in the force of Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim. Its fame made it popular among young nobles, striving for making a career in the cavalry.
}

itmname_blade_19	{Naval Saber}
itmdescr_blade_19
{
A comissioned prize saber of a naval officer. This weapon is equally great for a parade, for cutting tangled rigging and for landing a deadly strike in a most unexpected position.
}

itmname_blade_20	{Madonna}
itmdescr_blade_20
{
A menacing saber of the Hungarian hussars. This blade had just recently shown up on the battlefield of the Western Europe, but has already earned respect. Clearly, it has a bright future.
}

itmname_blade_21	{Highland Backsword}
itmdescr_blade_21
{
A traditional Scottish basket-hilted sword is the favourite weapon of the clan elite. You can afford to be a fierce and violent highlander, if your hand is safely protected and your blade strikes true.
}

itmname_blade_22	{Prophet's Wrath}
itmdescr_blade_22
{
An old and almost straight light saber with а curved handle, which is equally well suited for both slashing and piercing strikes. The razor-sharp blade slips as easily between the armor plates, as between the ribs.
}

itmname_blade_23	{Scimitar}
itmdescr_blade_23
{
Richly decorated birecurvate blade, intended for quick skirmishes. The shape of the blade encures the most powerful slashing strikes. Ancient relics are hidden in the pommel of this saber - they're supposed to repel unholy forces.
}

itmname_blade_24	{Patissa Khanda}
itmdescr_blade_24
{
Holy weapon of indomitable Indian Sikhs. The steel of an awesome quality allows to cleave enemy blades. The hilt is somewhat unusual for the Europeans, although it allows to land hits with the pommel.
}

itmname_blade_25	{Flamberge Rapier}
itmdescr_blade_25
{
This Spanish style cup hilt rapier with flamberge blade is a very dangerous weapon - both for the opponent and for its wielder. Even the light wounds made with this blade are healing very slow. The owners of such blades are disliked by the military and by the law.
}

itmname_blade_26	{Asoleda}
itmdescr_blade_26
{
A long duelling verdun foil with a light and very narrow blade. This makes slashing strikes impossible, but at the same time such a blade will not allow the enemy to get to the attack distance and will easily find a breach in his defense.
}

itmname_blade_27	{Swept-hilt Rapier}
itmdescr_blade_27
{
This rapier was named 'Saxon Feather' for a reason - great balancing allows the wielder to land slashing and piercing strikes with ease, since the blade obeys the slightest movement of the hand. Intricate guard provides decent protection for the hand.
}

itmname_blade_28	{Katana}
itmdescr_blade_28
{
A Japanese sword with a blade made of super high quality steel anв with a long handle, allowing to wield it with one or both hands.

}

}

itmname_blade_30	{Naval Klewang}
