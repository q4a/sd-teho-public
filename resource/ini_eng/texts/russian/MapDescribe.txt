This is #sMapIslName#. The location of the hidden treasure is shown here - it's #sMaplocName#. A famous pirate has hidden his treasure there.
Judging by the brown blood stains, the map is genuine - this also indicates that it had been changing owners quite often.

type_full_1
{
On the map of #sMapIslName#. The treasures are located in #sMaplocName#. But only by checking it out you can see if it's still there.
The map is rather ancient and there are no doubts about its genuineness.

type_full_2
{
This map is a fresh one - the paper hasn't turned yellow yet. If the legend is correct, the treasure is hidden in #sMaplocName# on #sMapIslName#. Is it really there? It's worth checking!

type_quest_0
{
This is #sMapIslName#. The location of the hidden treasure is shown here - it's #sMaplocName#. #sMapOwner# has hidden his treasure there.
Judging by the brown blood stains, the map is genuine - this also indicates that it had been changing owners quite often.

type_part
{
This is one of the parts of the map, which, apparently, leads to the treasure. There's not enough information, and you cannot tell the location of the treasure just by that piece. You can only hope that you eventually get hold of the second part of this map, which should be around somewhere.
And then everything will be clear!
}

type_fake
{
This map indicates the location of the treasure. Of course, you can check whether it's there or not, but sure as hell it's just a forgery.
You should just dispose of this piece of paper.
